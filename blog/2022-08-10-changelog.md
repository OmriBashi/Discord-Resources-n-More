**Introducing New Language Support!**

We are more than pleased to announce that the Discord Resources Wiki now supports 3 new languages. Over the past few months, our volunteer translators have worked hard to make our website more accessible to people whose first language isn't english, so be sure to thank them in #Chat . Every two months we will have a polish week to update all the languages to the most updated version of the wiki.

**The following languages are now available:**
> â€” ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª ` Deutsch ` <br/>
> â€” ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¸ ` EspaÃ±ol ` <br/>
> â€” ğŸ‡¹ğŸ‡· ` Turkish ` <br/>
> â€” ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡· ` FranÃ§ais `  <br/>
